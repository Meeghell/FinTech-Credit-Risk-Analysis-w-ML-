# Credit Risk Classification

In this analysis, we aimed to build and evaluate machine learning models to predict credit risk. The primary goal was to identify whether a loan is healthy (low risk) or high risk based on historical lending data from a peer-to-peer lending services company.

## Purpose of the Analysis

The purpose of this analysis is to develop a reliable model that can predict the creditworthiness of borrowers, thereby helping lenders make informed decisions and mitigate financial risks.

## Financial Information and Prediction

The dataset includes financial information such as:

- Loan size
- Interest rate
- Borrower income
- Debt-to-income ratio
- Number of accounts
- Derogatory marks
- Total debt

The target variable to predict is the loan status, where:

- `0` indicates a healthy loan
- `1` indicates a high-risk loan
